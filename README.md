## MRC Partnership Overview
This event involves partnering with our local Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) to promote public health awareness within the community. Our group collaborates specifically with the Loudoun County Medical Reserve Corps, guided by MRC Volunteer Coordinator Ms. Elizabeth Thurman. Together, we strategize and plan impactful future events that highlight the importance of public health and volunteer engagement.

# What have we done so far?

On November 16th, held a walkathon at the beaver dam reservoir with partnership with MRC. Through this event we were able to educate people on how exercise, hydration, and probiotic play a vital role in maintaining your gut and hormonal health.

On November 20th, we distributed motivational flyers to help raise awareness about the importance of maintaining good gut health. The posters contain key facts and practical tips about our gut, which we believe is important for everyone to know. With our colorful design, the message is both understandable and memorable. By sharing simple yet beneficial facts about gut health, we hope to inspire healthier habits in our community.

On November 27th, we visited the Loudoun County Homeless Shelter and prepared gut-healthy meals for over 80 people in need. Our menu included fiber and probiotic-rich foods, such as broccoli, grapes, and yogurt, to promote overall well-being. By providing these nutritious options, we not only helped address immediate hunger but also contributed to supporting the long-term health of those we served. 

On November 30th, we worked with the MRC as well as a few HOSA members to create and distribute positive message cards for INOVA hospital patients. Specifically, we distributed cards to patients within the PCU which is the Progressive Care Unit, this gave participants a way to help patients as well as gain an insight on the medical field by giving them an opportunity to interact with various health professionals in the unit. We were able to distribute cards to the entire unit which was around 24 patients! 

However, we went beyond our initial events. We completed various emergency courses such as FEMA as well as promoting our public health efforts through educational social media posts. Overall, in the past 2 months we have impacted our community and HOSA chapter by spending a total of 35 hours in partnership and impacting 150+ people ranging from students at Academies of Loudoun to patients at inova.
